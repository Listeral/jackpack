Me // I am Jack Pertschuk, 17 years old, a designer and the Online Editor for the Berkeley High Jacket.

It // I inherited from my predecessor a powerful custom built node.js application, called Cardigan, to manage all of the 120+ writers, editors, illustrators, and photographers on our staff. But parts of the code were unstable, and it was full of ambigious language that was difficult to work with so I rewrote it in PHP. This is JackPack.
I sacrificed the speed node.js offers in order to make the code more accessable for others interested in contributing to or using this tool. Enjoy.
